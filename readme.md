# Getting started 

## Installation

### Tailwind CSS
Make sure you have installed Tailwind CSS. 
I recommand using the standalone version

see -> `https://tailwindcss.com/blog/standalone-cli`

### Go dependencies
Install all required dependencies by running the following command:

`go get .`

### MAKEFILE
The project uses a makefile to run the server and the client.
To run the server, use the following command:

`make dev`
